		<b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b><br><br>
		Dear Eileen,<br><br>
		Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> 
		of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br><br></p>

		<h1><b>Starting dates</b><br></h1>

		<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
		could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br><br></p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
			<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
			<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
		You can find more information about <a href = "https://www.google.ca/">important university dates</a> on our website.<br><br></p>

		<h1><b>Subjects of study</b><br><br></h1>

		At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
		somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
		the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
		by are as follows, in order of priority:<br><br>

		<ol>
			<li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
			<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>
				audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
			<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
		research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br><br>

		<b>Exotic dance moves</b><br><br>
		Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
		my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>

		Polynesian chicken dance<br>
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br>
	Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
modern styles such as Twerking.<br>
	Arctic robot dance<br>
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
because they were really cold.<br><br>

For more of my research, see my <a href = "https://www.google.ca/">exotic dance research page.</a><br><br>

Yours sincerely,<br><br>
Dr Eleanor Gaye<br><br>
